# Speaker Diarization

#### Speaker diarization refers to the task of "who spoke when". We report results on the AMI corpus. We achieved a DER of 14% using an i-vector extraction based approach. To run the code, you would need to download the ami corpus, set up directorties as requried by the code and execute the refactored-scalable code notebook.
